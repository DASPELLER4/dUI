# dUI
C library for making simple GUIs in the linux TTY

This project has ended, it is to an acceptable quality so you may use it within reason in your projects, I will respond to bugs and minor feature requests but no major changes will occur. If you wish to use dUI in x11, I have made dUI-x11, which is my current hobby project and is worked on.
